This program is meant as a minor utility with the board game Merchants of
Venus in regards to discovering cultures. Instead of needing to draw the IOUs
from a bag or placing them on the board at the start of the game, risking them
accidentally being revealed, this program will randomize which culture is
found when you need it. 

If you use this program mid-game, you can edit the text file to put a / at the
beginning of the culture's entry in the text file which will indicate to the
program to ignore that culture. That way you will not be told you have a found
a culture that has already been disovered on the board.
