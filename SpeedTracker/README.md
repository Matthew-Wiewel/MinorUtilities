This is a simple program I created to keep track of scores between myself
and another person in regards to games of Speed.\*

Why do this instead of just using a text file? Because I wanted to overcomplicate things.

Note: The data.txt file in my local directory is not present in this repository. If you wish to use this
program, first create a data.txt file of your own. If has the format of

<number of games>
<number of matthew-player wins>
<number of justin-player wins>

\*The way Speed is played is that you use a normal deck of cards. In the center are dealt
two stacks of 5 cards and two single cards. (total 12, all face-down). Each player is dealt a hand of 5 cards that
they are allowed to look at. They are also given 15 other cards in a deck that they do not look at from
the beginning. Once the players agree to start, the two single cards in the center are flipped. At this point
now the players have a goal to get rid of all their cards first. Cards can be played in a sequential order. (Example:
a card in the middle is a 5. The player can either place a 4 or 6 from their hand on that card. Aces wrap around. Either a king or a 
2 may be placed on them.) After placing a card from their hand, the player takes a card from their deck of 15. If neither player
can place any more cards, the top cards of the side decks of 5 in the center are flipped and play continues.
