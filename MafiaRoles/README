First you'll want to create two files players.txt and roles.txt
The format should be to list each player on a separate line in players.txt
and each role on a separate line in roles.txt
The number of players and number of roles should be the same

ex

(Players.txt)
Player 1
Player 2
Player 3
Player 4
Player 5

(roles.txt)
Role 1
Role 2
Role 3
Role 4
Rol4 5
